class Game (Thread)</br>
class Player</br>

One game contains one current_player which points to opponent. Two players points to each other.</br>
    
class Model: mocks memory and database, recording runtime players and games status. </br>
</br>
Gateway (app.py) receives incoming requests and creates games(threads) to do work. Or if game exists, "notify" it. </br>
