# Two-player Checkers

## Tools
Back end: flask, flask-socketio, python </br>
Front end: jQuery, angularjs, socketio, bootstrap, javascript </br>

## Design
==========Back end==========
class Game (Thread) contains: </br>
    current player (Player) <--(points each other)--> opponent (Player)
    board array: len=64, val in [-1, 0, 1]
    board value encoding (signed 32-bit int * 4): | 0~31 current player | 32~63 current player | 0~32 opponent | 32~63 opponent | 
    json payload: mocks input stream of socket, because flask-socketio does not return connection instance. 
    ...
</br>
class Player contains: </br>
    pointer to opponent
    socket id
    ...
</br>    
class Model: mocks memory and database

Gateway (app.py) receives incoming requests and creates threads to do work.


==========Front end==========
main controller |socket connection<----gateway| <-----send request-----  view controllers

main controller |one socket connection----> dispatcher| -----dispatch response----> |gateway------>handlers| view controllers
